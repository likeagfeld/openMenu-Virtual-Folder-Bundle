# openMenu Virtual Folder Bundle

This is a new version of openMenu with virtual folder/subfolder support and other updates and fixes, including a modified version of GD MENU Card Manager to support it. It aims to be the ultimate menu software and SD card management solution for SEGA Dreamcast [GDEMU](https://gdemu.wordpress.com/about/) users.

openMenu was originally written by [mrneo240](https://github.com/mrneo240/openmenu/), later forked by [megavolt85](https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu), and then finally [sbstnc](https://github.com/sbstnc/openmenu/). With each iteration, important updates have been made to this open source menu software for the GDEMU, a SEGA Dreamcast optical drive emulator.

However due to the fragmented nature of these forks and the lack of time for each of their respective owners to contribute to the them, the author of this new openMenu build has decided to create a brand-new fork, rather than contribute to any of the existing ones. As an active member of the Dreamcast community, this author will work hard to maintain, update, and fix this new version of openMenu.

To accommodate the new openMenu, a modified version of [GD MENU Card Manager](https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager) has also been developed and included in this bundle.

## Changes to openMenu and GD MENU Card Manager

Many components of both openMenu and GD MENU Card Manager have been drastically overhauled for this version. See below for a list of changes.

### Changes Since openMenu v1.3.0

- New folder view mode, plus custom themes:
  * 8 subfolders max
  * Complete subfolder path maximum length is 256 characters, including backslashes (e.g., `Games\JP\RPG`).
  * L Trigger + R Trigger is now a shortcut to go back one directory
- Long entry names now supported (256 characters), along with marquee scrolling over those exceeding 49 characters.
- Scroll mode improvements:
  * Jumping cursor fixed
  * Toggle index numbers in the game list (On/Off)
  * Toggle artwork display (On/Off)
- Settings menu now has wrap-around cursor scrolling.
- GDEMU firmware version and openMenu build version now shown in the settings menu.
- VMU configuration save file is no longer written on every openMenu startup, now only when saving settings or during save file migration.
- Non-game discs are mounted by GDEMU instantly, returning user to BIOS for things like playing audio CDs.
- Game ID is not sent to VM2/VMUPro/USB4MAPLE when a non-game disc is launched (e.g., an audio CD).
- VMU beep setting disabled (feature is not implemented yet).
- Credits updated.

### Changes Since GD MENU Card Manager v2.0.1

- Game list column widths and window width adjusted for better visibility.
- Version check in About window removed (with possibility of returning in the future).
- A new "Folder" column added when building menu in openMenu mode, allowing users to specify virtual folder path for a disc image (e.g., `Games\RPGs\NTSC-U`).
- Non-game disc images now supported, with a new column named "Type" added where users can select from two drop-down options: `Game` and `Other`. Note that non-game disc images are automatically assigned the `Other` value, as openMenu will check this property to decide how to initialize the GDEMU.
- Disc image names no longer limited to 39 characters, increased to 256 characters.
- Disc numbers can now be customized by the user (e.g., `1/3`, `2/4`).
- Maximum length for game IDs is now ten (instead of 9), but is customizable by changing the `ProductIdMaxLength` key inside `GDMENUCardManager.dll.config`.
